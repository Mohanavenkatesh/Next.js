# Day 3 Learning Notes

## What I Learned Today

In this day, I learned about **Next.js CSS Modules** and specifically worked with `home.module.css`.

### Key Concepts Covered:

1. **CSS Modules in Next.js**
   - CSS Modules allow you to write CSS that is scoped to a specific component
   - Files are named with `.module.css` extension
   - Styles are automatically scoped to prevent naming conflicts

2. **Working with `home.module.css`**
   - Created modular CSS styles for the Home component
   - Learned how to import and use CSS modules in React components
   - Understood the benefits of component-scoped styling

3. **Component Structure**
   - Organized components in a structured way with separate folders
   - Created About, Home, and Services component directories
   - Implemented modular CSS for better maintainability

### Benefits of CSS Modules:
- **Scoped Styles**: No global CSS conflicts
- **Better Organization**: Styles are co-located with components
- **Type Safety**: Better IDE support and error checking
- **Maintainability**: Easier to manage styles for individual components

### Next Steps:
- Continue exploring Next.js features
- Practice with more complex component styling
- Learn about other styling approaches in Next.js
